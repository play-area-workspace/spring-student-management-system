# Student Management System

## Overview

This project is a simple Student Management System developed using Spring Boot. The primary objective of this project is to gain hands-on experience with Spring Boot and its various features. Through this project, I have learned and implemented several core concepts of Spring Boot and backend development.

## Features

- Add, update, delete, and retrieve student records.
- Integration with PostgreSQL for database operations.
- Utilization of Spring Data JPA for seamless database interaction.
- Implementation of RESTful APIs for CRUD operations.
- Use of Hibernate for ORM (Object-Relational Mapping).
- Input validation and error handling.
- Transaction management.

## Technologies Used

- **Spring Boot**: Core framework for creating the backend application.
- **Spring Data JPA**: For database interactions and CRUD operations.
- **Hibernate**: ORM tool for managing relational data.
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database management system.
- **Maven**: Dependency management and build tool.
- **Java 17**: Programming language used for development.

## Learning Outcomes

Throughout the development of this project, I have achieved the following:

1. **Spring Boot Fundamentals**: Understanding the basics of Spring Boot, including project setup, dependency management, and application configuration.
2. **RESTful Web Services**: Creating and managing RESTful APIs, handling HTTP requests and responses, and implementing CRUD operations.
3. **Database Integration**: Configuring and connecting to a PostgreSQL database, performing database migrations, and managing data with Spring Data JPA.
4. **ORM with Hibernate**: Mapping Java objects to database tables, understanding entity relationships, and handling database transactions.
5. **Validation and Error Handling**: Implementing input validation and managing exceptions to ensure robust and user-friendly APIs.
